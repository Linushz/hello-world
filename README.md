# hello-world
Back to coding. Project 1/100. 

Medical Student, formerly. Switched career to something CompSci-adjacent. The goal is to solve real world problems for me,  friends & family, and ultimately people around me. Finding fulfilling day-to-day work is the goal. Autonomy, problem-solving, team-environment and service-mindedness are my core values.
